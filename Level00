vi /tmp/dump.txt

suspicious looking file path: ./bin/.../flag00
(apparrantly /.../ has being used to try and hide the file)

exit vi with :q

file /bin/.../flag00 shows that it's a ELF 32-bit executable

geteuid()  = 999
getpwuid(999, 0x142c55, 0x8048549, 0x287ff4, 0) = 0x289c88
puts("You have...text from above)
